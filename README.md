# C Programming — Functions and Recursion
# Overview
This repository contains my practice programs based on functions and recursion in the C programming language.
These programs helped me understand how functions work, how to pass parameters, and how recursion can be used to solve repetitive problems in a simple and structured way.

# My Work
I have practiced and implemented several programs related to functions and recursion, including:

-Addition of two numbers using functions

-Factorial of a number using recursion

-Fibonacci series using recursion

-Armstrong Number Checker

-Prime Number Checker

-Sum of digits using recursion

-GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) using recursion

-Power of a number using recursion

-Reverse of a number using recursion


# About Functions
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Functions make code more readable, reusable, and organized.

# About Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself until a base condition is met.

It is widely used in problems like factorial, Fibonacci series, and finding GCD.

# Key concepts
-Function declaration and definition

-Recursive function calls

-Base condition and call stack


# Summary
These programs improved my understanding of C functions, recursion, and logic building for problem solving.
